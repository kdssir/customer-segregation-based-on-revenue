# Customer-Segregation-based-on-Revenue

POC of the application unsupervised algorithm Kmeasn Clustering for segregating the customers based on revenue
To segragate the customer based on SGN and Revenue data, we'll be following the below mentioned steps.
1. Loading the data
2. Basic Data Visuaization
3. Data analysis
4. Exploratory Data Analysis 
5. Visualizing the data disctirbution among all the features
6. Finding out the correlation between the features
7. Feature Selection
8. Model Training
7. Using the Elbow method to validate the value of K

Post loading the data, we'll visualizing the data as it is. Post which we'll be displaying the info from the dataframe and the description about the dataframe, which include the info like
1. Mean
2. Standerd Deviation
3. Max
4. Min

Post which we'll be analysing the uniques count from all the columns.
Feature selection will occur based on this check.

Exploratory data Analysis(EDA) will be then take place, which include the analysing the distribution of the data and boxplot.

Post which Data Preprocessing will take place and the model training after.

For validation of the value of K, we'll be using elbow method. Calculate the inertia values and will look for best suited value of K.
